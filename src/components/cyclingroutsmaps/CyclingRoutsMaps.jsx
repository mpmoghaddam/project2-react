                          <p>Nearly xxx% of all trips and over xxx% of commute trips in Calgary are by bike, exceeding the Cityâ€™s 2025 target of xxx% and on track to achieve the 2040 target of xxx%.</p><br />
                          <p>To help build on this shift, we have made cycling a much safer and more attractive option, by adding protected bike lanes to key city streets.</p><br />

                          <p>Protected bicycle lanes are dedicated bike lanes with concrete medians and planters, bicycle parking corrals, or vehicle parking lanes that divide them from vehicle traffic.</p><br />
                          <p>This separation increases feelings of safety and comfort, which makes cycling an attractive commuting option for those who are not used to riding their bikes regularly.</p><br />
                          <p>When people walking know that people won't be riding their bikes on the sidewalks, walking feels more comfortable, as well.</p>

                                <p>On 11th avenue, protected bike lanes provide two-way travel for people cycling on the same side. This can create the need for additional traffic signals for both cycling and walking traffic.</p>
